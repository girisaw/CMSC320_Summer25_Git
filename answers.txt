Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it can help us manage our code and data over time. Using Git
we can track our changes are review revision history by pushing changes at optimal times. We can also 
revert to a previous version and collaborate with others on projects which would be helpful for our
final group project.
